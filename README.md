1. Naive Bayes
Implemented Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library and dataset available with name glass. 
Used train_test_split to create training and testing part 
Evaluated the model on test part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

2. SVM Method
Implemented linear SVM method using scikit library and using the same dataset with name glass.
Used train_test_split to create training and testing part 
Evaluated the model on test part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred) 

Conclusion:
Based on the data, the GaussianNB accuracy is 55.81% and the SVM technique yielded an accuracy of 74.42%. This indicates that the SVM Algorithm performs well in this scenario with the same test size and random state.
